details: A specification is a technical document that tells you how a thing works. If you’re building cars, a specification tells you how a car works. It includes the most important details and perhaps a list of requirements that the end product should fulfill. Once the car gets built, the owner’s manual shows a driver how to operate and maintain the car. Similarly, if you’re building APIs, a specification tells you how an API works, along with the most important details. The documentation shows a consumer how to work with the API.

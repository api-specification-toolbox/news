details: Today, API security leader and creator of the industry’s first API Firewall, 42Crunch, announced the release of new IDE OpenAPI (Swagger) editing plugins for both Eclipse and JetBrains family of IDEs including IntelliJ and PyCharm. s42Crunch’s free OpenAPI security audit plugins simplify REST API development by delivering features such as OpenAPI navigation, code snippets, intellisense, and HTML preview. More importantly, the plugins help developers take their API security to the next level by delivering audit reports right to the developer’s IDE. Thus, engineers discover and address security vulnerabilities as early as API design and development time.

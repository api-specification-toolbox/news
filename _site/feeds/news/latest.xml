    <content><![CDATA[Today, API security leader and creator of the industryâ€™s first API Firewall, 42Crunch, announced the release of new IDE OpenAPI (Swagger) editing plugins for both Eclipse and JetBrains family of IDEs including IntelliJ and PyCharm. s42Crunchâ€™s free OpenAPI security audit plugins simplify REST API development by delivering features such as OpenAPI navigation, code snippets, intellisense, and HTML preview. More importantly, the plugins help developers take their API security to the next level by delivering audit reports right to the developerâ€™s IDE. Thus, engineers discover and address security vulnerabilities as early as API design and development time.]]></content>

    <title>AsyncAPI partners with Postman to boost development of Asynchronous APIs</title>

    <content><![CDATA[I'm proud and honored to let you know that we're partnering with Postman to boost the development of Asynchronous APIs to a new level ðŸš€ Since the very beginning, I knew the duty we had at hand was challenging. And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around. Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.]]></content>

    <title>Bringing law and order to APIs with OpenAPI Specifications</title>

    <updated></updated>
    <content><![CDATA[A specification is a technical document that tells you how a thing works. If youâ€™re building cars, a specification tells you how a car works. It includes the most important details and perhaps a list of requirements that the end product should fulfill. Once the car gets built, the ownerâ€™s manual shows a driver how to operate and maintain the car. Similarly, if youâ€™re building APIs, a specification tells you how an API works, along with the most important details. The documentation shows a consumer how to work with the API.]]></content>
